Pascal's triangle - first row is 1, 2nd is 1 1, etc.  However, choose n k - n corresponds to n+1th row of pascals triangle.
So in problem it asks for 51st row, that will be up to choose 50 25 etc.

However, steve has a comment:
; there are 614 distinct numbers. the largest is 126410606437752
; from the binomial theorem it is 50! / 25! 25!
; therefore the maximum square prime we need consider is 49

I don't get that.  Checking the rejected ones, however, 49 is highest.

Comment from forums:

"Any prime dividing C(n,k) is â‰¤ n, so you need only the primes up to 47."

Of course!  we know what the possible primes are, because it's factorial.  Derp.
Revised to use more efficient primes:
